                <h1>Dear potential employers</h1>
                <p>Thanks for taking your time to come and read my digital resume. First , let me introduce a little about myself. My name is Joseph. I am Vietnamese. I came to the United States in 2007. As you know, I'm not a native citizen and I've faced so many different things to look after myself. I had to work a lot of hours in the week. But I have a passion for coding, I wrote code in my free time, playing games, etc.
                    I went home to get married. I have been busy since getting married, but my coding passion never ends. So I studied online and once, I knew Lambda school on the internet. I signed up and learned more about computer science. Now, I am looking for an opportunity to enter the IT industry. If you allow me to take the very difficult first step in this industry, I would appreciate that. I may not have as much experience as you want, but I can and like to learn to fit my employer needs. Please take your time to see some of my works <a href='skillsAndProjects.html'>HERE.</a></br>
                    
                </p>
                <p id='end'>Thanks.</p>
